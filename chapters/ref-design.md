# Reference Design

###Intro  
An ONetSwitch dedicates to networking applications, as what the product name implies. The 'All-Programmable' allows the users to get any of their inspiration realized by customizing the gateware and/or the software.  
Reference designs here would help you
* to comprehend the usage of board components in different cases  
* to avoid developing from scratch, especially for beginners
* to share your mind and contribute to our community

> _The letter 'O' in the product name stands for 'Open'._  
> _We invite you to share when in such complicated network development._
