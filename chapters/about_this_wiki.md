# ONetSwitch
An ONetSwitch is hardware platform for network prototyping as well as deploying. It features 'All-Programmable', suiting kinds of users in different design roles or levels.  
The platform adopts Xilinx Zynq SoC as its main silicon, assembling all or part of following peripherals, supporting varied kinds of network applications.  
* Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T)  
* 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GBASE-R)  
* Mini PCIe (used for WLAN or NAS extension)  
* High-Speed Memory (QDRII+ or DDR3)  

The SoC based platform, by nature, and enhanced by the FPGA logic, can be easily customized into types of networking devices, either any legacy switches/routers or  next-gen networking(NGN) applications. Reference designs here on the Github could be good choice of the start point.
